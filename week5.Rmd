knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
# 基本

```{r}
x<-3
x1<-c(1,2,3)
x2<-c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
x
x1
x2
```

## 統計量

```{r}
x<-c(2,3,4,6,7,4,3,2,9)
mean(x)
median(x)

```
```{r}
x<-runif(400)
length(x)
mean(x)
median(x)
var(x)
quantile(x)
sd(x)
fivenum(x)
range(x)
min(x)
max(x)
```
 

```{r}
x<-seq(0,1,by=0.2)
x
```

```{r}
x<-seq(0,1,by=0.3)
x[1]
x[2]
x[3]
x[4]
x[5]
x[0]
```



```{r}
x<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
x[3]

idx<-c(1,3,5,7)
x[idx]

x[c(1,3,5,7)]
length(x[-7])

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
